## Lantern Economics Survey 

Lantern Economics is a pilot project, looking to investigate the feasibility of bringing an entirely new approach to a discipline struggling to produce meaningful policy advice in an ever more complex and interconnected world. The Lantern methodology breaks from conventional academia in almost every way, with its core ideas being that the economy is a complex system and should be approached as such, that software and AI should provide both standard tools and a framework for building/testing larger economic ideas and philosophies, and that the efforts of any economist searching for insights should feed into a larger, collaborative 'peer to peer' network.

We are looking for feedback from professional economists on the proposed Lantern project, and any time taken to complete the survey below would be hugely appreciated. _*Note: please read the 'About' page for a description of the Lantern project before answering the survey*_

_*We also welcome feedback from students and those more widely interested in Economics. If not working professionally in economics could you please state this in your answer to question 6*_

      <label><strong>7)A core concept of Lantern Economics is that the main aim of Economics is to allow decision makers to correctly understand the likely outcome of their policy choices. For this reason, Lantern will measure the success of contributor’s work based on how much they can improve the accuracy of a Global Economic Model. Do you consider this a sensible approach?</strong></label><br>
      <input type="radio" id="7.1" name="entry.677728773" value="Very sensible">

      <label><strong>8)Another core concept is that ideas are only useful if well verified and well known. Given the controversy that surrounds competing economic theories, Lantern proposes to make the outputs of the Global Economic Model to be predictions of interest, such as stock market and bond market changes. These are of interest to many non-economists and aim to bring engagement with the public at large. Do you think this is a good idea?</strong></label><br>

      <label><strong>9)Lantern Economics would create a platform for economists to create sub-models which would then be integrated into the overall Global Economic Model. This would allow theories on specific areas of the economy to be tested. Would you want to collaborate and engage with Lantern to contribute your own sub-models?</strong></label><br>
