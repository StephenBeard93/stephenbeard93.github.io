## Lantern Economics - The Concept

Lantern Economics is a pilot project, looking to investigate the feasibility of bringing an entirely new approach to a discipline struggling to produce meaningful policy advice in an ever more complex and interconnected world. The Lantern philosophy breaks from conventional academia in almost every way, with its core ideas being that the economy is a complex system and so should be approached as such, that software and AI should be both standard tools and a framework for building/testing larger economic ideas and philosophies, and that the efforts of any economist searching for insights should feed into a larger, collaborative 'peer to peer' network.

## What is the Goal of Lantern Economics

Economic theories are invisible, seemingly illusory and often too complex to be engaged with by the general public or by policy makers. However these theories are hugely powerful and underpin our approach to dealing with the greatest problems of our generation, such as climate change and the need to lift billions of people out of absolute and relative poverty. Unless Economics can be revolutionised as a discipline, it will fail to provide the policy advice and framework to tackle these great problems. 

We believe that theories need to be tested, and that the best way to test them is to use them to make models which make real world predictions that can be validated. Predictions are also engaging for general people, so we advocate building *global economic models* that make predictions regarding stock markets, bond markets and general economic development. All models can then be assessed against real world outcomes (as well as historic simulations), and those that do well will gain credibility. 

Of course global models are hugely complex and in reality are composed of potentially hundreds of sub-models, which themselves may contain their own sub-models. Creating just one global economic model seems daunting, but modularisation is at the heart of the Lantern concept. The goal is to create an open-source model where economists can liaise with Lantern and build sub-models that fit into the overall *global economic framework*. While economists create the ideas to be tested (the sub-models), Lantern Economics' role is to design, build and maintain the software which can combine all produced sub-models into numerous global economic models, which themselves can then each be run as a simulation.
Lantern Economics' goal is to take a highly technology driven approach to create a platform which allows economics ideas to be truly tested.

## The Lantern Methodology

The Lantern philosophy does not promote any particular ideology, but instead focuses on creating a system that allows economic theories to be meaningfully tested, their usefulness assessed and any insights they uncover to be fed into a larger framework. Below is a step by step description of the proposed process that any researcher who collaborated with Lantern would go through:

| Step | Description |
|-------|----------|
| Decide to work with Lantern | Great! You've had a clear piece of research in mind, but you don't just want to write another article which will gather dust. Instead, you want your work to contribute to a much larger project where it can feed into a collaborative systematic search to gain true economic insight. |
| Check you've got the right skills | Make sure that you have at least basic programming skills in Lantern's main programming language. | 
| Review the current Lantern Framework | The Lantern Framework is the scaffolding on which the *global economic model* is built. This effectively breaks down the economy into different sectors (i.e., GDP prediction, Capital Markets and Flows, International trade, etc...) and maps out how these sectors communicate and how economic data flows from one sector to another within the model. The proposed Lantern project is designed to be highly modular, meaning that you can translate your research into a small sub-model which fits into the overall framework. |      
| Submit a proposal | You've reviewed the framework and can see a missing piece, so it's time to fill in the online form to propose a project. Your project will then be assessed by our panel to 1) to make sure that a similar project does not already exist 2) check that the key assumptions in your model are defensible (i.e. not clearly contradicted by real world evidence) 3) check that it is testable (i.e. that it makes predictions using readily available macroeconomic data and so can be tested on historic data and on future performance) and 4) to give it an overall score to assess its potential usefulness. |  
| Feedback | You will receive feedback on your project, which will have both input from our panel of economists and from our software engineers. The software engineers are responsible for making sure that work undertaken can integrate into the overall framework, and will therefore offer technical guidance and requirements on this |
| Approval and resource allocation | If your project is approved then you will be allocated resources. Resource allocation refers to Lantern staff time required to integrate your finished sub-model within the overall framework. | 
| Build your sub-model | Build your sub-model | 
| Sub-model integration | Once completed and reviewed, your sub-model will be integrated into the main Lantern Framework. Integration does not mean that your sub-model will be used in the main framework, rather it means that it will be available for use. One of the founding concepts of Lantern is that an economy is a complex system, and so the true usefulness of your sub-model will only be revealed by testing its predictive capabilities when combined with numerous other versions of the Lantern Framework. Building software capable of automatically combining numerous sub-models within the Lantern framework and running their historic simulations is a major goal of the project. |

## Where Is The Lantern Economics Project Now? 
Lantern Economics is at the pilot stage and we are currently gathering feedback from the Economics community to gauge interest and gather valuable feedback. If you would like to share your opinion on this project please complete the form found under the survey tab at the top of the website.
