## Fresh Economic Thinking Meets Cutting Edge Technology

Lantern Economics is on a mission to build the world's best global economic models, and by so doing aims to uncover ground-breaking economic insights with real world applicability to both financial markets and government policy. Our economic models are continually evolving and are built using Lantern's unique methodology, which consists of three core principles: 
<ol>
  <li><strong><em>unbiased</em></strong> - Economics is divided into many differing and contradicting schools of thought. Lantern Economics does not build models limited by the theoretical basis of one school of thought. Instead we assess every underlying assumption that we use and always try to select the most empirically well supported theories on an assumption-by-assumption basis. This rigorous and intuitive approach differs sharply with the dogmatic economic ideologies used to build most major economic models </li> 
  <li><strong><em>Complexity theory</em></strong> - We believe that the economy is a complex system composed of thousands and thousands of variables. While some aspects may best be modelled by a simple cause and effect relationship, there are many more aspects of an economy which would be most effectively modelled using various techniques from <em>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</em>, such as machine learning, deep learning and artificial life
  <li><strong><em>Modular</em></strong> - The only way to test a theory is to see whether it's inclusion into a global economic model (GEM) can increase the overall predictive power of said GEM on a long-term historical simulation. Each theory is effectively a sub-model within the overall GEM, and there could be hundreds of sub-models composing a GEM. One of the core goals of Lantern is to create a highly modular framework, which will allow sub-models to be automatically replaced by competing sub-models of the same type, and a new historic simulation run to find out if the competing theory increased predictive power for the GEM. A modular framework facilitates rapid testing and improving of our GEM.</li>      
</ol>   

## The Private Sector Meets Economic Research 
  
Economic theories are invisible, seemingly illusory and often too complex to be engaged with by the general public or by policy makers. However these theories are hugely powerful and underpin our approach to dealing with the greatest problems of our generation, such as climate change and the need to lift billions of people out of absolute and relative poverty. Unless Economics can be revolutionised as a discipline, it will fail to provide the policy advice and framework to tackle these great problems. 

For these reasons Lantern Economics aims to establish itself as a social enterprise. We aim to publish an open annual report detailing all our latest findings and insights discovered from our research. The social mission is to demonstrate the remarkable gains that can be made in the field of economics by adopting a radical new methodology in our approach to economic research. 
  
Our publicly published report will always be somewhat behind our latest global economic model and research. To generate revenue we aim to offer a range of high value products and services based on our latest research to financial institutions looking to gain priceless macroeconomic insight. Any well researched, tested and validated macroeconomic insights will be of enormous value to financial institutions.  

## Be Involved In Something Big 
Lantern Economics is looking to build a core panel of academic and industry experts to progress the project further. We're on the lookout for rockstar economists, AI specialists, software engineers and statisticians.
