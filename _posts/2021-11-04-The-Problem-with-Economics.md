## The Problem With Economics:

The lack of consensus within economics on many fundamental issues often causes me to wonder whether the discipline has made any meaningful progress since Keynes penned his famous book ‘The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money’ in 1936. Arguably the most famous economic text ever written, it’s telling that modern economists are still split over some of the book’s core assertations. 

Of course, there are good reasons why economists have failed to all converge on some enlightened understanding, the most obvious being that Economics is a science without adequate scientific instruments, a discipline lacking in discipline and at its heart, a failure to understand the organic, emergent complex system that is an economy. 

The sheer scale and interconnected nature of everything and everyone in the world makes it a mind bogglingly complex system, far beyond the reach of any supercomputer simulation that we can do now or likely ever (even with the advent of quantum computing). As a system, the economy finds it’s best parable in the shape of weather forecasting. Like the economy, weather has thousands of interacting elements, and the slightest change to just one of them has been shown to make huge differences in predicted outcome (at least over short-term forecasts). This is where chaos theory arose, in the discovery in the early 1960s that rounding meteorological inputs to three decimal places rather than six caused a completely different weather forecast.

Of course weather forecasts have improved since the 1960s, driven by far more complex and realistic atmospheric simulations and the advent of computing. But at the heart of every weather forecast is a simulation which is itself just a simplified set of laws and assumptions about the atmosphere. Chaos theory describes the limitation of simulations in complex systems, and with weather forecasting we see the cumulative effect of small errors in prediction resulting in the complete breakdown of accurate weather forecast beyond one to two weeks from the current date. 

Economics is arguably a more difficult complex system to model than the weather. After all water and carbon dioxide molecules behave in a predictable manner, i.e. a water molecule should do the same thing when exposed to the same circumstances repeatedly. People on the other hand do not behave like this, culture and upbring complicates the situation, along with the ability of people to remember past outcomes and therefore to constantly update their behaviour. 

Measurements are much harder too. It’s reasonably straight forward to use weather balloons laden with scientific instruments to record the moisture content and temperature at different heights of the atmosphere in different locations. But macroeconomic data is no where near as detailed or reliable and this is something the discipline will likely just have to work around.

Recognising the complexity of the challenge presented by Economics allows us to see that the approach taken to understanding it needs to replicate that taken by meteorology, with likely even more innovation and collaboration required to begin to build and create theories that are predictive and useful in the real world. 
But this has not been the approach taken by macroeconomists. Macroeconomic research generally focuses on one specific area of the economy, attempting to first find a clear correlation between historical variables and then to use this correlation to make some future prediction. But as I have just outlined, an economy is a highly complex system that needs to be modelled as a whole if we are to understand the effects of any one area. 

So why has economic research focused so much on small specific segments of the economy rather than examining and testing the whole system? I think this is likely a symptom of how research is structured, with economists all working individually or at best in small teams. Building a global economic model is far too large a task for even a small team to achieve, and hence there is no choice for economic researchers other than to adopt an approach that is destined to fail from the outset.
